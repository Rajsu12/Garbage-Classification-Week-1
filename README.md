# Garbage-Classification-Week-1
In this project, I worked on classifying garbage images into categories like cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash. The goal is to support automatic waste segregation using image-based classification. During Week 1, I focused on understanding the dataset, preprocessing images, and building a basic image classification model.
